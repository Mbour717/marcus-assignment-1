        <h2>Patented Technology</h2>
        <p>Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating functional music, including technology to elicit strong neural phase locking-
          allowing populations of neurons to engage in various kinds of coordinated activity-and technology to remove distraction in sound.
        </p>
        <p>This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you into a desired mental state. In other words, we've found new ways to create music 
          that helps you do what you need to do.

        <h2>Tested on Brain and Behavior</h2>
        <p>Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic insitutions to run experiments.</p>
        <p>We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using fMRI and EEG, and also run large-scale behavioral tests, 
          measuring performance on simple games.
        </p>
        <p>Our experiments always include a control condition ('placebo') of the same underlying music without Brain.fm technology applied,
          so we can be sure our tech is what makes the difference.
